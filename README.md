# RTIW Bot
**R**andom **T**hings **I** **W**ant!

## What is this?
This is a Discord bot designed solely for random features I wanted
for my personal server I use to keep notes (yes, I use a discord server for notes...)

Right now, it tracks updates for a game called CS:GO, and tracks YouTube uploads for a 
YouTuber named EthosLab. Very random things, but they're what I want at the moment!

Not very configurable at the moment!!! I'm working on it next :D

## Why???
It was fun!!

I've never really worked with the Discord API before, and this was also a great way 
to further familiarize myself with Node's event structure and overall usage. I learned
a lot, even though this is a pretty straightforward bot if you look at the code. Makes me wanna code more!!

I absolutely could've just used any of the many bots available out there, but I'm glad I made it myself :D

### How To Host (if you'd want to do that for... some reason?)
```bash
git clone https://github.com/RoyalTwo/RTIW-Bot.git
npm init
node .
```
