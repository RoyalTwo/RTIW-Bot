# RTIW Bot
**R**andom **T**hings **I** **W**ant!

## What is this?
This is a Discord bot designed solely for random features I wanted
for my personal server I use to keep notes (yes, I use a discord server for notes...)

Right now, it tracks updates for a game called CS:GO, and tracks YouTube uploads for a 
YouTuber named EthosLab. Very random things, but they're what I want at the moment!

Not very configurable at the moment!!! I'm working on it next :D

## Why???
It was fun!!

I've never really worked with the Discord API before, and this was also a great way 
to further familiarize myself with Node's event structure and overall usage. I learned
a lot, even though this is a pretty straightforward bot if you look at the code. Makes me wanna code more!!

I absolutely could've just used any of the many bots available out there, but I'm glad I made it myself :D

### How To Host (if you'd want to do that for... some reason?)
If for some reason you'd like to, this can be built from source normally. Just remember any hidden keys needed!
- Clone the repo, and make a new file in the folder called ".env"
- In .env, paste the following:
    ```bash
    BOT_TOKEN=""
    BOT_ID=""
    DB_URL=""
    ```
Put your values into the quotes. BOT_TOKEN and BOT_ID are obtained from your Discord Developer page, and DB_URL is the URL to your MongoDB database.
